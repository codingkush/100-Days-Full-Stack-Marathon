# 🚀 100 Days Full-Stack Marathon  
**React (Modern) + Spring Boot + Testing + Realtime + Deployment**

A strict, project-based 100-day journey to become an **industry-ready full-stack developer**.  
Every day focuses on **learning by building real projects** with clean architecture & best practices.

---

## 🎯 Marathon Objective

This marathon helps you master **frontend + backend full-stack development**, covering:

---

## 🔵 Frontend (React)

- Modern React (Hooks, Context, Redux Toolkit, React Query)
- React Router v6+
- Tailwind CSS + reusable components
- Forms + validation (React Hook Form)
- LocalStorage, SessionStorage, browser APIs
- Performance optimization
- Infinite scrolling patterns
- Realtime UI (WebSockets, WebRTC)

---

## 🔴 Backend (Spring Boot)

- Controllers → Services → Repositories → DTO
- JPA, Hibernate, relationships, pagination, sorting
- Global exception handling
- File upload & download handling
- Swagger / OpenAPI documentation
- JUnit 5 + Mockito (Unit & Integration Testing)
- Spring Security 6 + JWT (access + refresh tokens)
- Caching, performance tuning
- APIs for infinite scrolling, filtering, search
- WebSocket backend for chat & notifications

---

## 🟣 Full-Stack Integration

- Connect **React ↔ Spring Boot**
- JWT protected routing
- Full authentication flow
- Realtime communication
- Production-grade architecture
- Deployment ready applications

# 🧠 Daily Workflow & Expectations

Every day in the marathon includes:

✔ Concept of the day  
✔ Mini-project or feature implementation  
✔ Strict rules/constraints  
✔ Expected output or deployment  
✔ Reflection notes  

# 🏗 Major Projects You Will Build

Progressively, you will build:

### 🔵 React Projects
- Counter App  
- Todo App  
- Weather App  
- Notes App (localStorage)  
- Form Validation App  
- Multi-step Form (React Hook Form)  
- Movie Search App (API + pagination)  
- E-commerce Cart (Redux Toolkit)  
- Blog UI + Routing  
- Infinite scrolling news/feed  
- Protected Dashboard UI  

### 🔴 Spring Boot Backend Projects
- CRUD REST API  
- User authentication API  
- File upload/download service  
- Search + filter + pagination API  
- Swagger documentation  
- JWT authentication + refresh token cycle  
- WebSocket messaging backend  

### 🟣 Full-Stack Projects
- Todo app + backend CRUD  
- Authentication system (React + Spring Boot + JWT)  
- Admin Dashboard  
- File upload client + backend  
- Chat App (WebSockets)  
- Video calling app (WebRTC signaling)  
- Final production-grade full-stack system  

Each project grows in complexity and mirrors **real industry development**.

# 📌 Rules of the Marathon

To maintain discipline and quality:

- Minimum **1 hour/day** (non-negotiable)  
- No skipping — if skipped, the next day = **double work**  
- Every day must produce a **visible output**  
- Every day must include a **README summary**  
- Clean folder structure + naming conventions required  
- Push to GitHub **daily**  
- Build at least **1 feature per concept**  
- Do NOT jump to backend unless frontend foundation is complete  
- No copy–paste — build your own implementations  

### 📅 End-of-Week Ritual

At the end of each week:

✔ Write a weekly summary  
✔ Evaluate weaknesses  
✔ Plan next week’s improvements  

This ensures consistency, reflection, and growth.

# 📝 Weekly Review (Optional Section)
Each week you will add a short note:

### Week 1 Summary
- Concepts learned:
- Projects built:
- What I struggled with:
- What I improved:
